## 🌟 Story Behind the Code  
I built this interactive website to surprise my girlfriend on **Women’s Day**! It features a hidden 3D rotating heart, custom cursor animations, and a heartfelt message. When she clicks "OPEN", the love page reveals a **360° interactive heart** with "I LOVE YOU" text. Perfect for coders who want to romance their partners uniquely!
